starting something new 
I grew up around coding but for some reason never learned more than severe basics for use on my wordpress blog or in the occasional D&D forum. Now I'm back attempting to learn a bit. I was always taught to have skills and knowledge and it was bothering me that I didn't have at least ONE of these skills...so here I am and here I go.
